# Elden Ring - Interactive Map - Item Progression

[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) script (or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)) to allow marking items on the [interactive map](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map) of **Elden Ring** as completed. The interactive map is a Fextralife-project, all credits for the map go to them.

To mark an item as completed, **right-click** it. Completed items are shown with opacity on the map:

The status is persisted locally in the browsers `localStorage`, so it remembers completed items even if the page or browser has been closed.
